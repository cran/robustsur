Description: Data sets are often corrupted by outliers. When data are multivariate outliers can be classified as case-wise or cell-wise. The latters are particularly challenge to handle. We implement a robust estimation procedure for Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models which is able to cope well with both type of outliers.
